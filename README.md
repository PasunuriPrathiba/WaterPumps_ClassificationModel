# WaterPumps_ClassificationModel
The ministry of water of an African country has made a data set of pumps  installed in various places in the country to serve the water for their countrymen.
It is a  tedious and expensive task to maintain these pumps. This data set contains information  such as the kind of pump, when it was installed,
and how it is managed. Can you predict  which pumps require repairs and which are not functional by using the given data set?
A  smart understanding of water point failure can improve maintenance operations and ensure  that clean and safe water is available to these communities.
Experiment with a few methods  such as tree based methods, bagging, boosting method, support vector machine etc. and  comment on the suitability of
the method to predict the classes. Before implementing any  model, visualize the data and comment on the data statistics.
